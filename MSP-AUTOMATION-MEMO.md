# MSP Automation Architecture Memo

## Overview
Complete automation setup for small MSP with personal touch, vendor independence, and multi-project reusability.

## Core Components

- **Features**: 
  - i18n support (fr_FR, nl_NL)
  - Modular helper system
  - Git-based version control
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented and functional

### 2. Ansible (Service Orchestration)
- **Location**: Office server (private, behind NAT)
- **Purpose**: Centralized server management, user provisioning, service lifecycle
- **Features**:
  - User management across multiple servers
  - Service provisioning/suspension automation
  - Inventory-driven configuration

- **Solves**: NAT traversal, secure communication, direct networking
- **Architecture**: 
  ```
  Invoice Ninja (public) ←→ WireGuard ←→ Office Server (private)
  ```

### 5. Cockpit (Web Management Interface)
- **Location**: Office server
- **Purpose**: Web-based server management dashboard
- **Benefits**: Remote administration, monitoring, user management GUI
- **Access**: Through WireGuard VPN

## Architecture Flow

### Payment Processing
```
Customer → Invoice Ninja → Payment Gateway (Stripe/PayPal) → Webhook → WireGuard → Office Server → Ansible → Target Servers
```

### Service Management
```
You → Cockpit/SSH → Office Server → Ansible → Target Servers
```

### Billing Lifecycle
1. **Service Request**: Customer contacts you (personal touch maintained)
2. **Quote & Invoice**: You create invoice in Invoice Ninja
3. **Payment**: Customer pays via Stripe/PayPal
4. **Automation**: Webhook triggers Ansible playbook
5. **Provisioning**: Services automatically deployed
6. **Ongoing Management**: Cockpit + Ansible for maintenance

## Key Benefits

### Vendor Independence
- ✅ Payment processors: Switchable (Stripe ↔ PayPal)
- ✅ Billing platform: Self-hosted, no customer limits
- ✅ Server management: Open source tools
- ✅ VPN: Standard WireGuard protocol

### Personal Touch Maintained
- ✅ Customer communication stays human
- ✅ Service decisions require your approval
- ✅ Professional invoicing without complex portals
- ✅ You control all technical implementations

### Multi-Project Reusability

### Cost Structure
- **Invoice Ninja**: Free (self-hosted)
- **Ansible + Cockpit**: Free (open source)

- **WireGuard VPS**: ~$5-10/month
- **Only costs**: VPS hosting + payment processing fees

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Set up WireGuard VPN between office and public VPS
2. Install Invoice Ninja on public VPS
3. Install Ansible + Cockpit on office server
4. Test secure connectivity

### Phase 2: Integration
1. Configure Invoice Ninja webhooks
2. Create Ansible playbooks for common tasks
3. Set up webhook receiver on office server
4. Test payment → automation flow

### Phase 3: Migration
1. Migrate from Sprout Invoice to Invoice Ninja
2. Document service provisioning procedures
3. Train on Cockpit interface
4. Implement monitoring/alerting

### Phase 4: Scale
1. Add holiday rental project to same system
2. Optimize Ansible playbooks
3. Add more servers to WireGuard mesh
4. Implement backup/disaster recovery

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Test WireGuard setup with hosting provider
2. **Week 1**: Install Invoice Ninja on test VPS
3. **Week 2**: Set up basic Ansible + webhook integration
4. **Month 1**: Full migration from current tools

## Notes
- Architecture supports dozens of customers efficiently
