# Karen Etc Directory

This directory contains configuration files that are **generated by Karen or created by administrators** and are specific to this server instance.

## Purpose
- Stores server-specific configurations generated by Karen
- Contains admin-created configurations that are not part of the base distribution
- Houses customized versions of templates that have been processed for this server

## Important Notes
- **Not tracked in git** - these are server-specific configurations
- **Can be enabled or disabled** by creating/removing symbolic links in `/etc/`
- Files here may reference server-specific values (domains, paths, credentials, etc.)
- Safe to version control separately if needed for backup purposes

## Typical Contents
- Server-specific Apache/Caddy configurations
- Customized PHP-FPM pool configurations
- Database connection configurations
- SSL certificate configurations
- Environment-specific settings

## Usage Pattern
1. Karen generates configurations from templates using server-specific data
2. Files are placed in this directory with proper structure (mirrors `/etc/`)
3. Admin can review and modify files if needed
4. Symbolic links are created from `/etc/` to enable configurations
5. Links can be removed to disable without deleting the configuration

## Directory Structure
This directory mirrors the `/etc/` structure to make it clear where each configuration belongs.
