# Force file-based mutexes to prevent SSL handshake issues
# Benefits: Avoids race conditions with high-traffic SSL sites
# Alternative: sem (SysV semaphores) can cause issues on some systems
# File-based mutexes are more reliable but slightly slower
Mutex file:${APACHE_LOCK_DIR} default

# SSL-specific mutex (uncomment if experiencing SSL issues)
#Mutex file:${APACHE_LOCK_DIR}/ssl_mutex ssl-cache
